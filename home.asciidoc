== Welcome to robobuddy

Currently, we are a few link:members[colleagues] interested in robotics that want to do more than just dreaming about building robots. Time to wake-up and bite the apple...

The plan is to have a link:meetings[meeting] every two weeks, trying to get an impressive amount of hard and software up-and-running.

While doing so, interesting link:links[links] will be added

Infrared Distance Sensor Type E18-D80NK

This is an Infrared Transmitter and receiver which together make up a photoelectric sensor. The sensor has a long detection distance, and has less interference by visible light because it uses modulated Infrared light. This sensor has a screwdriver adjustment to set the detected distance, then gives a digital output when it senses something within that range. This sensor does not return a distance VALUE.
